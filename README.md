## Our Process

### Precedent Study

We began to tackle the problem with a precedent study to understand how the current process works.

What we found was a [very dated website](http://www.bbbscharlotte.org/site/c.7gLMK5MKLgIUF/b.6422729/k.9374/Be_a_Big_8212give_a_Little_something_back.htm) that required users to download the [application](https://github.com/nickbreaton/hackathonclt-2017/raw/master/docs/Volunteer%20Application.docx) as a Microsoft Word document, then email or fax it to Big Brother Big Sister Charlotte.

### Design Philosophy

We decided to use [material design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/) to promote a user friendly experience in order to retain the attention of potential mentors throughout the entire process.

## Final Product

A working version of the site can be found [here](https://nickbreaton.github.io/hackathonclt-2017/).
